clone the repo, `python main.py` and the program will tell you the rest. the servers are added to servers.txt. also i probably should mention that you have to change the gamedir parameter in the server lister. by default it's `u"tf"` you can change it to whatever you want `u"cstrike"`, `u"garrysmod"` idk
